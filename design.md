# Design

## Design patterns

### Model-View-Controller

## SOLID

### S is for single responsibility principle
**Classes should have a single responsibility, a single purpose.**

### O is for open/closed principle
**Classes should be open to extension but closed to modification.**

### L is for Liskov's substitution principle
**Subclasses should be able to be used anywhere a superclass is used.**

### I is for interface segregation principle
**Classes should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.**

### D is for dependency inversion principle
**Depend on abstractions, not concretes.**

## Dependency inversion (DI) and inversion-of-control (IoC) containers

## Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) principle

## Domain driven design (DDD)
