## Pull requests


### Opening a pull request


### Reviewing a pull request
1. Be thorough in the review to reduce iterations and time wasted through communication, waiting, and context switching.
2. Communicate how strongly you feel about feedback. Typically, we prefix comments with. For example, prefix comments with "nitpick" or just "nit" for something nitpick-y that you want changed or improved. Usually something small.
3. Identify straightforward ways to simplify the code while respecting scope.
4. Again, a PR should be narrowly focused. It should, within reason, do one change well. If the author needs to reduce the scope of changes, consider saying so.
5. Offer alternative solutions, but assume that the author already considered them. For example, "What do you think about using a custom validator here?"
6. Checkout the branch and try the changes locally. You can determine how much manual testing to preform.
7. If you don't understand the code, you're probably not the only one. "Can you explain the code used here?" Asking *appropriately, professionally* does not make you look stupid. Suffering in silence does.

1. Read "Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track" by Will Larson. It's a great book on the types of staff engineering, what to work on, and so on.
2. GitLabs [values](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/), at time of writing this, are well thought out and address many topics on feedback, collaboration, iteration, and efficiency
